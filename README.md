# pylog-python-keylogger
This is a simple python keylogger that demonstrates how a victims keystrokes can be recorded and sent back to an attacker without the users knowing. It is set to start at startup so it ensures that all keystrokes is logged. It has been modified to check if there is an internet connection and if not -record all keystrokes to a text file.
